# PaperHFT:
PaperHFT is a Python package intended to provide a framework for building algorithmic trading bots that interact with popular paper trading websites.

## Current Capabilites:
* Can grab basic stock information as well as some limited technical indicator data from TradingView
* Can create a bot instance that can open and close long stock positions on Investopedia's stock simulator

## To-Do List:
* Interface with more paper trading websites (like WallStreetSurvivor & MarketWatch)
* Add the ability to open and close short stock positions & open long option positions (short option positions likely won't be possibly on simulators)

### Documentation:
#### In progress!
